## Part 1: Imaging Technique Inspiration

1. The images of example

2. The examples I've chosen are works from Georgiana Houghton's spiritual paintings. My intention is to mimic the intricate lines present in these works, as they possess artistic flair and offer visually rich effects. These works feature intricate lines that embody the essence of artistry and offer a kaleidoscope of visual effects. I aim to incorporate similar characteristics into my project.

## Part 2: Coding Technique Exploration

1.  Image and link related to the coding technique:

2. Moving on to my exploration of coding techniques, I've chosen a piece of code that closely replicates the effects seen in the example images. My plan is to modify this code to exert control over the number, direction, stroke, and stroke weight of the lines, aiming to achieve a comparable effect to the examples.
