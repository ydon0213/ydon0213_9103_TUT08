## Part 1: Imaging Technique Inspiration

1. The images of example
![Glory be to God](https://www.datocms-assets.com/42890/1688346188-1864_glory-be-to-god_rectotrim.jpg?dpr=1.5&fit=max&fm=webp&iptc=allow&w=1500)

2. The examples I've chosen are works from Georgiana Houghton's spiritual paintings. My intention is to mimic the intricate lines present in these works, as they possess artistic flair and offer visually rich effects.

## Part 2: Coding Technique Exploration

1.  Image and link related to the coding technique:

2. The effect of this code closely resembles the lines in the example images. I will modify this code to control the number, direction, stroke, and stroke weight, aiming to achieve a similar effect to that of the examples.
